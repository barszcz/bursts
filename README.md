# Bursts

(Eventually) A static-blogging framework-ish thing written in Clojure. Based on Magnar Sveen's [stasis](https://github.com/magnars/stasis/blob/master/src/stasis/core.clj).

## Features (so far)
* Markdown parsing with [markdown-clj](https://github.com/yogthos/markdown-clj), extended with support for footnotes
* Uses edn for post metadata (e.g. tags; most of my envisioned features are NYI)
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy of [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org)

## Wishlist
* Restructure how pages/posts are laid out to follow a React/Reagent-like, components-based approach
* Tags, tag pages
* Drafts (likely easy to implement)
* Post dates (probably next)
* Main page
* Pagination, "Jump"
* Gorgeous typography

## Usage

Maybe one day, but in the immediate term I'm envisioning this as merely what I'll use to run my own blog.
